title: IAM Credentials
description: "Learn about how SST apps use your IAM credentials."
---

SST uses your AWS credentials to deploy your app. Let's take a look at how to load these credentials, creating an IAM policy for SST, and the basic set of permissions that all SST apps need.

## Loading credentials

There are a few different ways to set the credentials that SST will use. Starting with the simplest.

### Loading from a file

You can keep your AWS credentials in a file. The credentials are found at:

- `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, Unix, and macOS;
- `C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

If the credentials file does not exist on your machine:

1. Follow [this guide to create an IAM user](https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-iam-user.html)
2. And then [use this guide to configure the credentials](https://sst.dev/chapters/configure-the-aws-cli.html)

The credentials file should look like:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

And if you have multiple credentials configured, it might look like:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <DEFAULT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

[staging]
aws_access_key_id = <STAGING_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <STAGING_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

[production]
aws_access_key_id = <PRODUCTION_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <PRODUCTION_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

By default, SST uses the credentials for the `[default]` profile. To use one of the other profiles, set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. For example:

```bash
$ AWS_PROFILE=staging npx sst deploy
```

### Loading from environment variables

SST automatically detects AWS credentials in your environment and uses them for making requests to AWS. The environment variables that you need to set are:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

If you are using temporary credentials, also set:

- AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

This is often the most convenient way to configure credentials when deploying your SST app in a CI environment. If you are deploying through [Seed](https://seed.run/), [follow this guide to configure IAM credentials](https://seed.run/docs/iam-credentials-per-stage).

### Configuring AWS Vault

If you are using [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) to store your IAM credentials locally, it needs to be MFA authenticated. Add the `mfa_serial` property in your AWS config file. This will cause AWS Vault to prompt for the MFA token.

### Configuring Leapp

If you are using [Leapp](https://www.leapp.cloud) to store your IAM credentials in your local environment, the IAM credentials need to be MFA authenticated.

Configure the `MFA Device ARN` when adding the credentials.

![IAM permissions Leapp setup](/img/screens/iam-permissions-leapp-setup.png)

Then Leapp will prompt for the MFA token when enabling the session.

## Creating an IAM policy

There are 3 strategies you can use to decide what IAM permissions you want to grant SST. The decision is primarily based on your use case and your team's security requirement.

### 1. Grant `AdministratorAccess` permission

This strategy is most suited to teams where each member has a personal AWS sandbox account. This arrangement provides developers with a secure environment in which they can experiment and innovate, while simultaneously protecting production environments from unintended disruptions.

### 2. Generate using IAM Access Analyzer

This strategy involves initially granting a broad permissions policy. After deploying the SST app and allowing it to run for a period of time, IAM Access Analyzer can be used to scrutinize your CloudTrail events and identify the actions and services utilised by the IAM user or role. The analyzer will then generate an IAM policy based on this activity, which can replace the original broad policy.

Detailed steps for this process can be found at the following link - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html

### 3. Least privilege policies

A comprehensive list of IAM permissions can be found in the [IAM permissions](#iam-permissions) section below. Please note that this list is subject to changes over time.

## IAM permissions

For SST to deploy and manage your applications, it requires certain IAM permissions. Below is an IAM policy with the list of required permissions which you can copy and paste directly into your AWS IAM console.

Let's break down the permissions list provided above and examine what each is used for.

### 1. Permissions required to bootstrap SST

SST needs to bootstrap once for each AWS account, per region. This happens automatically the first time you execute `sst deploy` or `sst dev`. You can [read more about bootstrap here](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/state/#bootstrap).

Below are the permissions required:

- Permissions to create the SST bootstrap bucket for storing application state.
  ```json
  {
      "Sid": "ManageBootstrapStateBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:CreateBucket",
          "s3:PutBucketVersioning",
          "s3:PutBucketNotification",
          "s3:DeleteObject",
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:ListBucket",
          "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::sst-state-*"
      ]
  }
  ```

- Permissions to create the SST bootstrap bucket for storing assets in your application, such as Lambda function bundles and static assets in your frontend applications. 
  ```json
  {
      "Sid": "ManageBootstrapAssetBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:CreateBucket",
          "s3:PutBucketVersioning",
          "s3:DeleteObject",
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:ListBucket",
          "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::sst-asset-*"
      ]
  }
  ```

- Permissions to create the SST bootstrap ECR repository for hosting Docker images in your application.
  ```json
  {
      "Sid": "ManageBootstrapECRRepo",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "ecr:CreateRepository",
          "ecr:DescribeRepositories"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:ecr:REGION:ACCOUNT:repository/sst-asset"
      ]
  }
  ```

- Permissions to create the SST bootstrap SSM parameter. The parameter stores the information of the deployed bootstrap resources.
  ```json
  {
      "Sid": "ManageBootstrapSSMParameter",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "ssm:GetParameters",
          "ssm:PutParameter"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:ssm:REGION:ACCOUNT:parameter/sst/passphrase/*",
          "arn:aws:ssm:REGION:ACCOUNT:parameter/sst/bootstrap"
      ]
  }
  ```

### 2. Permissions required by SST to deploy your application

The IAM permissions required to deploy your app depend on the resources your app uses. The template above grants a relaxed permission.

```json
{
    "Sid": "Deployments",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "*"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "*"
    ]
}
```

To enhance security, restrict the permissions to only what is necessary for deployment.

### 3. Permissions required by SST CLI

The SST CLI command also makes AWS SDK calls to your AWS account. Here are the IAM permissions required by the CLI:

- Permissions for SST to manage your [secrets](/docs/component/secret).
  ```json
  {
      "Sid": "ManageSecrets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "ssm:DeleteParameter",
          "ssm:GetParameter",
          "ssm:GetParameters",
          "ssm:GetParametersByPath",
          "ssm:PutParameter"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:112233445566:parameter/sst/*"
      ]
  }
  ```

- Permissions for SST to connect to IoT endpoint for [Live Lambda development](/docs/live).
  ```json
  {
      "Sid": "LiveLambdaSocketConnection",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "iot:DescribeEndpoint",
          "iot:Connect",
          "iot:Subscribe",
          "iot:Publish",
          "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "*"
      ]
  }
  ```
